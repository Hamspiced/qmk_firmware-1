# Fruitbar
Here are the QMK files for the fruitbar keyboard orignally run by: [Fruit](https://github.com/blewis308)
I have created these files to make the encoder work as the orignal one didn't, and I have added code to have an animated bongo cat
on the OLED screen. These files are also updated to the latest QMK MSYS at the time it was made. 

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make fruitbar:default

Make example for this keyboard to use Bongocat //This keymap was created rewritten entirely by CIllidge Thankyou for your work to make this project function properly.
    
    make fruitbar:bongocat
    
Make example for this keyboard to use VIA

    make fruitbar:via
